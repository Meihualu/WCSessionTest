Small testing app for the Watch OS 2 connectivity framework

This project contains the code for a simple Apple Watch and iOS 9 app to test the new connectivity framework in Watch OS 2. 
I wanted to see what happens with the application context after the device rebooted or when the watch lost the connection with the iPhone. 
Maybe it is also helpful for other developers who start with the connectivity framework.
